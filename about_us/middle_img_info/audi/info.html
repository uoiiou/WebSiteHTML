    Everything we do begins with the Audi customer and with his or her need for simplification and self-fulfilment – in short: for more freedom. At first, that may not sound like anything new – after all, we have always built vehicles for customers. What is new about this is the consistency with which we are following through with this approach. Instead of being perfect from the start, we are engaging in close exchange, improving products bit by bit, putting ourselves to the user test and going straight from there to the workbench. This is how we make personal freedom and mobility a unique experience.
